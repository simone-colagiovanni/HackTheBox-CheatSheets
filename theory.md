### 🧭 Overview of Information Security Concepts

- **Risk, Threat, Vulnerability**: Three foundational concepts that define the landscape of cybersecurity.  
- **Core Principles**: Confidentiality, integrity, availability, authentication, non-repudiation, and privacy.  
- **Key Processes**: Risk assessment, security planning, control implementation, monitoring, incident response, disaster recovery, and continuous improvement.  
- **Purpose of InfoSec**: Protect sensitive data, ensure business continuity, maintain compliance, preserve reputation, and support secure innovation.  
- **Essential Tools**: Firewalls, IDS/IPS, SIEM systems, vulnerability scanners, encryption, access control, and awareness platforms.  
- **Penetration Testing Basics**: Includes tools like Nmap, Wireshark, Metasploit, Burp Suite, and John the Ripper.

### 🧭 Overview of Information Security Domains

* **🌐 Network Security** – Protects data in transit through **firewalls**, **IDS/IPS**, **VPNs**, and **encryption**. Prevents unauthorized access and ensures business continuity.
* **💻 Application Security** – Embeds protection throughout the **software development lifecycle (SDLC)** via **secure coding**, **threat modeling**, and **testing** to maintain software integrity.
* **⚙️ Operational Security (OpSec)** – Focuses on protecting **day-to-day operations** and sensitive information through **access control**, **monitoring**, and **employee awareness**.
* **🌀 Disaster Recovery & Business Continuity (DR/BC)** – Ensures critical systems recover quickly after disruptions.

  * **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)** – Maximum acceptable downtime before services must be restored.
  * **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)** – Maximum acceptable data loss measured in time since the last backup.
* **☁️ Cloud Security** – Secures cloud-hosted data and applications using **encryption**, **identity and access management (IAM)**, **compliance controls**, and **shared responsibility models**.
* **🏢 Physical Security** – Protects hardware and facilities through **access controls**, **surveillance**, and **Red Team testing** to prevent tampering or theft.
* **📱 Mobile Security** – Safeguards mobile devices, their **data**, and **connections** using **biometrics**, **VPNs**, **encryption**, and **vetted apps**.
* **🔗 IoT Security** – Defends interconnected devices through **secure design**, **firmware updates**, **network segmentation**, and **continuous monitoring** to reduce exposure.

Would you like me to create a **matching detailed version** (`info-domains-details.md`) with short sections for each domain (like your “info-security-details.md” file)?
