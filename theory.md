# Chapter Title (concise)

## Summary
One-sentence summary of the concept and why it matters.

## Motivation / When it matters
Short explanation of scenarios or contexts where this concept is useful (e.g., reconnaissance, exploitation, post-exploitation, defensive analysis).

## Core Ideas
- Bullet 1: key principle or definition
- Bullet 2: second important aspect
- Bullet 3: limitations, assumptions or preconditions

## How it works (step-by-step / mechanics)
1. Step or component A — short explanation
2. Step or component B — short explanation
