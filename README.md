# HTB Cheatsheets — Notes and Resources 

**Purpose:** this repository is meant to keep track of useful information learned while following **Hack The Box** paths and modules — including theory, reusable commands, patterns, and external resources.  
**Important:** it does *not* contain machine or challenge solutions, walkthroughs, or spoilers. The goal is purely educational — to summarize knowledge and improve technical skills.

## Repository structure

- `theory.md` — theoretical concepts, protocols, methodologies, and mental models (e.g., SQLi types, authentication mechanisms, privilege escalation concepts).  
- `practical.md` — commands, snippets, reusable patterns, and templates (e.g., nmap/ffuf/gobuster commands, enumeration scripts, privesc checklists). **All generic and non-machine-specific.**  
- `links.md` — curated list of useful resources, repositories, documentation, blogs, and tools for pentesting / CTF / HTB.
